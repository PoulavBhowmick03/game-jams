# Haus of Sosij - Rugged

## Project Summary

Rugged is the high-risk trading simulator of the lost and greedy. Avoid getting rugged to become a Team Member, then hold and earn or rug and leave with the bag! Just don't get spooked too soon - plan carefully to maximise your profits and the size of your collateral damage.

V1, as seen in this game loop, deploys phase 1 of the game to Sepolia. This was what we attempted to achieve during the game jam. It involves a quick thrill gamble with a 30% chance of success. Players who manage to avoid getting rugged then enter phase 2, where fear and greed quickly take hold!



V2, as seen in this game loop, introduces phase 2 of the game. Players who avoid getting rugged in phase 1 now become ‘Team Members’ and must decide for how long to hold their position and earn dividends, and when to rug and leave wiv a bag.
